# Application Ideas
Stonehenge has a built-in marketplace for apps that it can automatically install
and manage on a given server. This document contains a few brainstorm-y ideas for
what some of those applications might be.

## Social Network

## Media Storage
This could just be a plex server install?

## Video Hosting

## Shopping Client

## Shopping Server
For companies hoping to provide an interface for customers to query inventory and
place orders

## Website Builder

## Server Saver
* Allow other users to log in to the server in case of lockout
* Allow remote support to log in for support on technical issues
* Allow remote backup scripts to run in case of data loss
