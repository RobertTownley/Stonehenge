INTRO_MESSAGE = """Welcome to the Stonehenge project builder!

To use this utility, you'll first create a configuration file, and
then build the project based off of that configuration.

You can either create the config file (stonehenge_config.py)
yourself, or you can run "stonehenge new" to generate a file with
some helpful pre-populated defaults.

Once the file has been created, you can run "stonehenge build" to
create your project.

For more information, or for usage examples, visit
https://github.com/RobertTownley/Stonehenge."""
